# Vision
This is a minecraft mod.
The goal is to be educational, detailed, and realistic representation of semiconductor manufactuing.
I am to practise working in this framework and build process for the firts time.
I'm also to compile a lot of my notes and knowledge on semiconductor manufacturing history here.
This has the potential to be fun to others.

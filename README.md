# Vision
This is a minecraft mod.  
The goal is to be an educational, detailed, and realistic representation of semiconductor manufactuing.  
I am to practise working with the framework and build tools of minecraft modding for the firts time.  
I'll also compile my notes and knowledge on semiconductor manufacturing here.  
This *has the potential* to be fun to others in a community I've been passionate about since childhood.

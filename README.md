# Vision
This is a minecraft mod.  
The goal is to be educational, detailed, and realistic representation of semiconductor manufactuing.  
I am to practise working in this framework and build process for the firts time.  
I'm also to compile a lot of my notes and knowledge on semiconductor manufacturing history here.  
This has the potential to be fun to others.
